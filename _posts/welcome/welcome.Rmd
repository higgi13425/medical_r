```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```

I hope to tackle topics including:

- Best Practices for Data collection and entry
- Data security and PHI
- Why to avoid using Excel
- If you absolutely must use a spreadsheet, how to do it well.
- Why you should invest in using REDCap
- Tools to get data from REDCap to R
- Exploring your data
- Making assertions about your data
- What is Tidy Data & Why it is Important
- How to make your data Tidy

These posts are often the first drafts for future chapters of RMRWR, Reproducible Medical Research with R, an work-in-progress e-book found at https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/

Thanks for reading!
