    "contents": "\nBuilding and Publishing a {bookdown} book on bookdown.org\nThis post will explain the steps involved to edit and create Reproducible Medical Research in R, which is published on bookdown.org, where you can create an account to publish your own e-book and share it with the world. Go ahead, go to bookdown to set up your own account.\nOnce you have an account,\nSetting up\nInstall the {bookdown} package, with install.packages('bookdown').\nThen run library(bookdown) in the Console to load the package.\nThen, in the RStudio IDE, Choose File/New Project/Book Project using bookdown.\nThen go to the Files tab, open index.Rmd, and click the Knit button. The Preview Window will show you a minimal example of a bookdown book. You can now start editing and adding new chapters.\nBookdown YAML\nYou can edit your _bookdown.yml file, which controls the setup of your book. I chose to have ‘manual’ control of chapter order, by listing the ‘ready for prime time’ chapters in the _bookdown.yml file in order. Draft chapters will not be included in the published book until I list them in this file.\nMy _bookdown.yml file looks something like this (more chapters being added):\n\n\nbook_filename: \"rmrwr\"\ntitle: \"Reproducible Medical Research with R\"\nlanguage:\n  ui:\n    chapter_name: \"Chapter \"\ndelete_merged_file: true\nnew_session: yes\nrmd_files:\n- index.Rmd\n- io02-getting-started.Rmd\n- io03-tasting.Rmd\n- io65-error_messages.Rmd\n- io04-updating.Rmd\n- io07-major-updates.Rmd\n- io08-data-validation.Rmd\n- io09-timeseries.Rmd\n- io10-tableOne.Rmd\n- io30-ttest.Rmd\n- io70-r_cmd_line.Rmd\n- io98-title-holder.Rmd\n- io99-references.Rmd\n\n\n\nOutput YAML\nYou can edit your _output.yml file, which controls the output and look of your book. My _output.yml file looks like this:\n\nbookdown::gitbook:\n  css: style.css\n  config:\n    toc:\n      before: |\n        <li><a href=\"./\">RMRWR<\/a><\/li>\n      after: |\n        <li><a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown\" target=\"blank\">Published with bookdown<\/a><\/li>\n    edit: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo/edit/master/%s\n    download: [\"pdf\", \"epub\"]\nbookdown::pdf_book:\n  includes:\n    in_header: preamble.tex\n  latex_engine: xelatex\n  citation_package: natbib\n  keep_tex: yes\nbookdown::epub_book: default\n\nNote that this file refers to a style.css file, which affects the appearance of your book, by using cascading style sheets (css) for formatting.

They will not be included until you list them in your _bookdown.yml file.\nAfter saving and knitting each chapter successfully, the finalized chapters can be included in the book build, and ordered, by adding them to the _bookdown.yml file, in between index.Rmd, and io98-title-holder.Rmd.\nChapter Names\nThe names of each of my chapters follow the convention, io##-Topic.Rmd. This is so that they will alphabetically follow index.Rmd and largely be in order.\nWhen a Chapter is Ready for Sharing\nAdd the new chapter to the list of chapters in order in _bookdown.yml, somewhere in between\n- index.Rmd and - io98-title_holder.Rmd\nNote that I need to have a title holder chapter as a placeholder, so that the Preface will not get a weird title from the last chapter. I am not sure why.\nIt just works.\nBuilding the Book\nRender the book with bookdown::render_book('index.html')\nPublishing the Book\nPublish the book withbookdown::publish_book(account = 'pdr_higgins')\nThen commit the changes and push to Github\nWithin a minute or three, the updated book will appear at: https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/\nLearn more\nMore details can be found at:\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/rstudio-connect.html\nand at\nhttps://bookdown.org/home/about/\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nGetting Started\n\n\n\nThese are general instructions on how to setup and install RStudio Server and Shiny server on a Linux machine. For the purposes of this walkthrough, we will assume that the server is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and that we have sudo rights to run all commands.\nInstall Apache\nWhile Apache is not a required component to run RStudio, I suggest using Apache (or nginx) to proxy the site so that users do not need to type or remember a port to access the webpage. Using apache also allows us to easily implement SSL/TLS. For our instance, start with:\n\nsudo yum install httpd mod_ssl \nsudo systemctl start httpd \nsudo systemctl enable httpd\n\nInstall R\nThis walkthrough will have you install R by compiling it from source. You can install R via your package manager (yum or apt). We’ve chosen to install it via source, the main reason being stability and consistency. If you install via the package manager, when a newer version of R is released, it will update your version if you update the system.\nBecause of this, I have seen instances where users would not update or patch their systems because they did not want to impact their version of R. By compiling from source, we allow users to properly keep their systems patched and updated without any worry about impacting their R version.\nAlso, researchers sometimes build code and pipelines based on a certain version of R. A sudden change to that version could cause potential issues. If these are not issues in your scenario, than you can install via the package manager if you like.\nInstall R Prerequisite Packages\nThese development packages help to ensure that R compiles with all of the capabilities R has available.\n\nsudo yum install bzip2-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel readline-devel libffi-devel libXext-devel libXt-devel xz-devel libcurl-devel libpng-devel libtiff-devel cairo-devel libjpeg-devel libicu-devel sqlite-devel libarchive-devel libXmu-devel blas-devel lapack-devel libxml2-devel\n\nCopy Script\nUsing your preferred editor, e.g. vim, nano, etc., copy the contents of the following script to the server. For the purposes of this walkthrough, I’ll call this script R-install.sh. You should also edit the prefix in the configure function line to match where you want R installed. Make sure you can actually to write to the directory you choose, or else the script will fail with permission denied errors.\n\n#!/bin/bash \n\nVERSION=4.0.3 \nmkdir /tmp/builddir \ncd /tmp/builddir \nwget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-$VERSION.tar.gz \ntar xvf R-$VERSION.tar.gz \ncd R-$VERSION ./configure --prefix=/app/apps/rhel8/R/$VERSION --enable-R-shlib \nmake \nmake install \nrm -rf /tmp/builddir \n\nRun script\nFor this walkthrough, I saved the script to /opt.\nThis process should take 10-15 minutes to complete.\n\nsh /opt/R-install.sh \n\nSet R into the PATH\nAgain edit the listed path to match where R was installed.\n\ncat <<eof>>/etc/profile.d/R.sh \nexport PATH=/app/apps/rhel8/R/4.0.3/bin:\\$PATH\nEOF\n\nInstall RStudio\nRStudio provides updated links to the latest install. Go to the RStudio download page, https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/\nand select the appropriate OS for your installation.\n\nwget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/centos8/x86_64/rstudio-server-rhel-1.3.1093-x86_64.rpm \nsudo yum install rstudio-server-rhel-1.3.1093-x86_64.rpm\n\nConfigure RStudio\nYou need to edit the configuration file /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf to include the following line.\nAs we did earlier, make sure this path is the same path where you installed R.\n\nrsession-which-r=/app/apps/rhel8/R/4.0.2/bin/R\n\nEdit Systemd Service File\nThis is a tweak to fix an issue that could cause Rstudio to not startup properly. First copy the original systemd service file.\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/rstudio-server.service /etc/systemd/system/rstudio-server.service\n\nThen, using your preferred editor, add the following line after 'Type=forking'\n\nStartLimitIntervalSec=0\n\nReload the systemd daemon and start the Rstudio Service as in the code chunk below.\n\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload \nsudo systemctl start rstudio-server \nsudo systemctl enable rstudio-server\n\nConfigure RStudio Vhost\nCopy the following code to a new configuration file for apache. For RHEL8, the configuration directory is /etc/httpd/conf.d\nYou can call the file rstudio-vhost.conf.\nYou will need to change the ServerName to the name you will be using for the webhost.\nYou will need to change the information for the SSL Certificate as well.\n\n<VirtualHost _default_:80=\"\">\n  RewriteEngine On \n  RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on \n  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R=301,L]\n<\/VirtualHost> \n\n<VirtuaHost *:443=\"\">\n  ServerName rstudio.example.com \n  \n  ErrorLog logs/ssl_error_log \n  # Does not work with IP v6 only IP v4\n  SetEnvIf X-Forwarded-For \"^.*\\..*\\..*\\..*\" forwarded \n  CustomLog logs/ssl_access_log combined env=!forwarded \n  CustomLog logs/ssl_access_log proxy env=forwarded \n  LogLevel warn \n  \n  ProxyPass / http://localhost:8787/\n  ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8787/\n  \n  SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/rstudio.example.com.crt\n  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/rstudio.example.com.key\n<\/VirtualHost> \n\nOnce the configuration is in place, you can restart Apache.\n\nsudo systemctl restart httpd\n\nOther Considerations\n###SELinux If you are running with SELinux in enforcing mode, you will need to set an SELinux boolean for Apache.\n\nsudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1\n\nInstall R Packages\n\nR \ninstall.packages(c('shiny','rmarkdown','devtools')) \nq()\n\nInstall RShiny\nRShiny provides updated links to the latest install.

    "contents": "\nGetting Started with Subgroup Plots\nSubgroup plots are a bit of a fetish of medical journals, as a way to rummage through the results, hunting for possible subgroups which might receive more or less benefit than the average participant.\nThese subgroup analyses, are of course, underpowered, as you are dividing the sample size of the overall study (in which you can usually barely afford to get 80% power) into multiple (underpowered) subgroup analyses. To make matters worse, you are often (at the request of multiple reviewers and editors), analyzing 15-25 subgroups, resulting in a real problem of multiple comparisons, and occasionally yielding an outlier that looks significantly different from the overall effect, but is probably only so by chance.\nMany statisticians have weighed in on what a bad idea this practice is (examples provided here, here, and here). However, they are just so much fun to look at that journal editors, particularly in the UK and at the New England Journal of Medicine are very reluctant to give them up.\nThis has led to some spectacular statistical trolling, most famously in the ISIS study, which showed the benefits of asprin for heart attack published in the Lancet in 1988. The statisticians involved were very resistant to providing a subgroup plot. They did so only under protest, at the editors’ insistence. In fact, if you click through the link to the paper above, and scroll to page 355 (figure 5), and turn your head sideways (or rotate the pdf), you can see that the authors made their first subgroup analysis by astrological birth sign. This is level 10 statistical trolling of the editors.\nSo how to make this work for your use case?\nLet’s walk you through how I did this for a 2020 paper in Lancet Gastroenterology. Note that I have a master’s degree in statistics, not a Ph.D. My day job is in gastroenterology and IBD research. So not being someone like Richard Peto, I am not in a position to do level 10 statistical trolling. So even though I know that this is statistically a bad idea, when the editors demand a subgroup plot, I am going to help out my co-authors and produce one.\nNote: a way better version\nRandy Boyes created here (@randyboyes) https://github.com/rdboyes/Forest_plot_with_table\nLoading the Libraries\nWe are going to start with the {tidyverse} and then add in {glue} and {scales}. I added {writexl} to store a copy of the oddly-formatted data in Excel for future reference (and to show co-authors how to format it if they wanted to change any #s). The packages {grid} and {gridExtra} are to do some fancy stuff outside of the plotting rectangle.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(writexl)\n\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nReading in the Data\nYou can take two approaches to produce the oddly formatted data. You will need two different kinds of rows:\nThe rows that name the type of subgroup - like Age, Obesity, Diabetes, etc. - these rows will have a lot of NAs, as they are mostly for display purposes.\nThe rows that contain the subgroup names, like:\nyoung (<65 years)/old (65 years or older)\nObese/Non-obese\nDiabetic/Not diabetic).\nThese rows will contain counts, estimates, lower confidence bounds and upper confidence bounds.\n\nThe example data below are from a randomized controlled trial of 100 mg vs. 200 mg indomethacin in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.\nThe full paper, including figure 2 on page 137, which is the resulting plot (with some formatting/UK spellings added by journal staff), can be found at: https://github.com/higgi13425/subgroup_plot/blob/master/lancetgastro_2020_indomethacin.pdf\nYou can read in an example of this kind of formatted data with the code chunk below.\nNote that you have one row with the group name in the group_subgroup column (which has all NAs in the numeric columns), followed by rows with the names of each subgroup with counts, estimates (in this case, risk difference percentages), and upper and lower confidence bounds.\n\n\nindo_data <- readxl::read_excel(\"indomethacin_ride.xlsx\")\nhead(indo_data, n=12)\n\n# A tibble: 12 x 6\n   group_subgroup                 lcb risk_diff_pct   ucb number num  \n   <chr>                        <dbl>         <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>\n 1 Age                          NA            NA    NA        NA 1    \n 2 45 or under                  -3.27          3.98 11.2     417 2    \n 3 Over 45                      -4.37          0.56  5.49    620 3    \n 4 Sex                          NA            NA    NA        NA 4    \n 5 Female                       -2.36          2.53  7.42    813 5    \n 6 Male                         -4.92          2.65 10.2     224 6    \n 7 Obese                        NA            NA    NA        NA 7    \n 8 Ob No                        -4.15          1.01  6.17    646 8    \n 9 Ob Yes                       -2.57          4.47 11.5     391 9    \n10 Sphincter of Oddi Dysfuncti… NA            NA    NA        NA 10   \n11 SOD No                       -4.1           2.28  8.66    388 11   \n12 SOD Yes                      -3.07          2.39  7.85    649 12   \n\nIf your collaborators can grok this format and produce an excel or csv in this layout, you are way ahead of the game. If not, you can manually code these into a dataframe (less fun). See the fairly icky example below. The values for counts and estimates were generated with standard {dplyr} groupby and count, with standard calculations for risk difference as a percentage and confidence bounds, with (purrr} to map over the groups. In a time crunch, I did not come up with a slick way to bind these groups vs subgroups into consecutive rows, and used the highly kludgy manual solution below.\nPretty lame, but it worked at the time.\nBut if anyone can come up with a slicker way to build the dataframe (using the example below), please let me know.\n\n\ngroup_subgroup <- c(\n  \"Age                  \", \"45 or under\", \"Over 45\", \n  \"Sex                  \", 'Female', 'Male', \n  \"Obese                \", \"Ob No\", \"Ob Yes\", \n  \"Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction \", \"SOD No\", \"SOD Yes\", \n  \"Hx PEP                \", \"HP No\", \"HP Yes\", \n  \"Hx Pancreatitis       \", \"Hpan No\", \"Hpan Yes\", \n  \"Difficult Cannulation                \", \"DC No\", \"DC Yes\", \n  \"Precut               \", \"Pre No\", \"Pre Yes\", \n  \"Sphincterotomy               \", \"Sph No\", \"Sph Yes\", \n  \"Pancreatography              \", \"Panc No\", \"Panc Yes\",\n  \"Acinarization                \", \"Ac No\", \"Ac Yes\", \n  \"Biliary Sphincterotomy                \", \"BS No\", \"BS Yes\", \n  \"Ampullectomy                \", \"Amp No\", \"Amp Yes\", \n  \"Prophy Pancreatic Stent                \", \"PS No\", \"PS Yes\", \n  \"Ther Pancreatic Stent                \", \"PS No\", \"PS Yes\",   \"Trainee                \", \"T No\", \"T Yes\", \n  \"Double Wire                \", \"DW No\", \"DW Yes\", \n  \"Aspirin                \", \"Asa No\", \"Asa Yes\", \n  \"Site                  \", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\n  \"Overall                \")\n\nrisk_diff_pct <- c(NA,3.98,0.56, NA,2.53,2.65, NA, 1.01, 4.47, #obese\n                   NA,2.28,2.39, \n                   NA, -0.22,16.87, NA, 1.88,3.04,  NA, 3.27, -0.21, NA, 2.49, 1.81, \n                   NA, 1.25, 3.29, NA,-4.97,3.2, NA, 0.97, 33.55,  NA, 4.48, 0.86, \n                   NA, 2.4, 0.63,   NA, 4.18, 0.83, NA, 2.0,7.65,   NA, 2.93, -2.45, \n                   NA, 2.19, 5.56, NA, 2.82, -0.95, NA, 4.69, -18.43, 0, 1.99, -10.48, -33.33,\n                   2.31)\n\nlcb <- c(NA,-3.27,-4.37, NA,-2.36, -4.92, NA, -4.15, -2.57, #obese\n         NA,-4.1,-3.07, \n         NA, -4.6,4.71, NA, -3.24,-4,  \n         NA, -1.53, -8.52, NA, -1.98, -10.06, NA, -4.13, -3.2, NA,-11.82,-1.52,\n         NA, -3.25, 11.03,  NA, -2.27, -4.4,  NA, -1.94, -14.11, \n         NA, -2.35, -4.51, NA,-2.66,-5.6,   NA, -1.49, -14.73,   \n         NA, -2.06, -16.97, NA, -1.6, -13.07, NA, -0.42, -41.15, 0, -4.03, -32.04, -86.68,\n         -1.87)\n\nucb <- c(NA, 11.2, 5.49, NA,7.42, 10.22, NA, 6.17, 11.52, #obese\n         NA,8.66,7.85, \n         NA, 4.16,29.03, NA, 7,10.09,  \n         NA, 8.07, 8.09, NA, 6.95, 13.67, NA, 6.63, 9.78, NA,18.85,7.91,\n         NA, 5.18, 56.07,  NA, 11.23, 6.12,  NA, 6.73, 15.36, \n         NA, 10.72, 6.18, NA,6.33,24.11,   NA, 7.35, 9.83,   \n         NA, 6.43, 28.08, NA, 7.26, 11.16, NA, 9.81, 4.28, 0, 8, 11.09, 20.01,\n         6.48)\n\nnumber <- c(NA,417,620, NA,813, 224, NA,646,391, #obese\n            NA,388,649, \n            NA, 860,177, NA, 625,412, \n            NA, 743,294, NA, 920, 117, NA, 561,476,  NA,158,879,\n            NA, 994,43,  NA, 445, 592,  NA, 975, 62, \n            NA, 336, 701, NA, 945,92,   NA, 885,152,  \n            NA, 1001, 36, NA, 895,142, NA, 760,48,4,179,41,5,\n            1037)\n\n\n\ndf <- tibble(group_subgroup, lcb, risk_diff_pct, ucb, number)  \ndf <- df %>%  mutate(num = as.character(1:62))\nwrite_xlsx(df, \"indomethacin_ride.xlsx\")\n\nBuilding the Plot - with Annotation by Comment\nThis is (mostly) a straightforward ggplot, with x as the risk difference percentage, and y the groups and subgroups, as indicated by the num variable (essentially the row number).

This is actually easier than inserting a learnr app - with no resizing messes.\nNote that it is essentially two html tags, one to open the iframe: <iframe> with a bunch of options/arguments,\nand then one to close the iframe: <\/iframe>\nThe style argument is basically some inline CSS styling. Note that I know almost zero CSS. You can get surprisingly far with web searches. Learn some minimal CSS here if you need to:https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp\nNote that if you have multiple iframes in your HTML, each one needs a unique id.\nYou can set the width and height (these seemed to work for me).\nThen set the source (src) to the link to github.io, with the first xaringan slide (#1) as the starting point.\nThen usually set scrolling to “no”. Your call.\n\n<!---FLIPBOOK EX 1--> \n\n<iframe style=\"margin:0 auto; border: solid black;\" \nid=\"myIframe8\" \nwidth = \"763\" height = \"432\"\nsrc=\"https://higgi13425.github.io/mini_flipbooks/ttest_flipbook.html#1\" \nscrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe> \n\n<!-------------> \n\nThen, build your website or bookdown book with this chunk in it.\nIt may be helpful to preface the first microflipbook with a bit of orientation for new users. Something like:\nSee the example flipbook below. You can click on it and move forward or backward in the slides with the left and right arrows to see what each line of code actually does.\nAnd your micro-flipbook should look something like this: Note that it will look like an empty box in the RStudio viewer, but trust: 3 steps:\nKnit the Rmd page\nBuild the website/book (Build tab)\nGit commit and push to Github\nin a minute or two, you will have a working flipbook on the web.\n\n\n\n<!————->\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nGetting Started on a Data Package\nMost blog posts about building packages and arm are about bundling functions that are related into a single package.This is a common usage of packages, but at times you may want to share some common data sets with users in the form of a package. This is not as well-documented, but can be valuable.  A few examples of data packages include:\nbabynames\nfueleconomy\nnasaweather\nnycflights13\nusdanutrients  To get started, you will want to follow the guidance in the R Packages Book at: https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html. This will be a quick getting started guide, relative to the big book (but use it as a reference if you get stuck).\nSetup\nYou want to have a new project open in RStudio, with the project named something like {datapackage} (pick a more appropriate name for your package). You then want to load (library commands in the Console) some critical packages including {devtools}, {usethis}, and {roxygen2}.\nlibrary(devtools)\nlibrary(usethis)\nlibrary(roxygen2)\nCreating the Package\nThen use the create_package() function to create your new package {datapackage}, by running this function in the Console (pick a better name than datapackage):\ncreate_package(\"datapackage\")\nThis will set up your directories and folders in the current project to help you create a package.\nVersioning with Git and Github\nIf you have never used git before for version control, this would be a good time to install and initialize git on your computer, using the guidance in Chapter 6 of Happy Git with R, at: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nDetails on how to configure git are in chapter 7, at https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html\nNow make a git repository to track your versions, by running this in the Console:\nuse_git()\nGo ahead and commit files when prompted to do so.\nIf you have never used GitHub before for version control and collaboration, this would be a good time set up a Github account and add a PAT (Personal Access Token) to your computer, using the guidance in Chapter 4 of Happy Git with R, at: https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html\nDetails on PATs (you want one, trust me) are found in Appendix B, at: https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html\nEdit the Description\nLook in your Files tab, open the DESCRIPTION file, and edit:\nMake yourself the author (and add collaborators!)\nadd a title\nadd a longer Description - who is it for, why would they want this data, what is a use case?\nAdd a License\nMke your life easy, and run use_mit_license() in the Console\nAdd data\nIn the Files tab in RStudio, create a raw-data folder. Add the files that you want to turn into your accessible datasets. Now create a separate data folder.\nIn the raw-data folder, create a new R script named prep_data.R. In this file, wrangle, filter, or otherwise prepare your datasets. Let’s pretend you have a datafile that you have wrangled from Excel, and it is now a dataframe named sportsdata.\nThen save this datasets in *.rda format, as sportsdata.rda. Pick the name carefully, as you will have to live with it for a long time.\nIn this script, do this saving with with saveRDS(sportsdata, \"data-raw/sportsdata.Rdata\")\nThen use the data (put in proper format in the data folder) with the following line in your script:\nusethis::use_data(sportsdata, overwrite = TRUE)\nInstall\nDeal with Dependencies\nDo you need to use other packages to run functions (most of the time not, for a data package)?\nOn the off chance you do, you will want to run: use_package()\nAs in, if you need readr to read in some data, run in the Console:\nuse_package('readr')\nSet up for push to GitHub\nRun in the Console:\nuse_github() This will link your project to a Github repository, so that you can share your datapackage with the world.\nBasic documentation\nCreate an R script in the R/ folder, named something like datapackage.R.\nIn this file, you can add roxygen2 documentation, which looks like a long list of funny-looking comments (they start with #' rather than just a hashtag).\nTypically you include:\na short description, in a sentence or two.\nafter the @format statement, details on the format (dataframe) and the dimensions (how many rows, how many columns), and a short description of each variable, with levels or units; and the data type.\nafter the @source statement, a description of where the data came from, often including a link.\nThis looks something like:\n\n\n#' Baby names.\n#'\n#' Full baby name data provided by the SSA. This includes all names with at\n#' least 5 uses.\n#'\n#' Lifetables\n#'\n#' Cohort life tables data as provided by SSA.\n#'\n#' @format A data frame with nine variables:\n#' \\describe{\n#' \\item{\\code{x}}{age in years}\n#' \\item{\\code{qx}}{probability of death at age \\code{x}}\n#' \\item{\\code{lx}}{number of survivors, of birth cohort of 100,000, at next integral age}\n#' \\item{\\code{dx}}{number of deaths that would occur between integral ages}\n#' \\item{\\code{Lx}}{Number of person-years lived between \\code{x} and \\code{x+1}}\n#' \\item{\\code{Tx}}{Total number of person-years lived beyond age \\code{x}}\n#' \\item{\\code{ex}}{Average number of years of life remaining for members of cohort alive at age \\code{x}}\n#' \\item{\\code{sex}}{Sex}\n#' \\item{\\code{year}}{Year}\n#' }\n#'\n#' For further details, see \\url{http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html#wp1168594}\n#'\n\"lifetables\"\n\n\n\nTo build this into a proper help file, you need to run devtools::document(). This will use roxygen2 to convert this to a *.Rd file in the man folder. This provides the “manual” for your data.\nTo build this into the package, re-build the package, with Cmd-Shift-B (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-B (Windows). This will rebuild the package and restart R.\nNow you should be able to call from the console:\n?dataset or help(dataset)\nand see your documentation.\nThen save it and make a Git commit and push the updated package up to your Github repository.\nAdvanced documentation\nDescription Document You can write a long description of the provenance of the data, when and how it was collected, where it was published in a journal, etc. (go for it, provide all the details!) in a Rmarkdown file (named something like datapackage_desc.Rmd), then knit this to pdf. When you push your project/package to Github, your pdfs show up properly formatted. You can then take the link to the pdf and put it in your README file, so that anyone can read up on your datasets. Codebook Document You can create a nice table of each variable, a longer description, units of measurement, levels/category codes and what they mean, in a nicely formatted Rmd table. Create a Rmarkdown file (named something like datapackage_codebook.Rmd), then knit this to pdf. When you push your project/package to Github, your pdfs show up properly formatted. You can then take the link to the pdf and put it in your README file, so that anyone can know what each variable in your dataset is about.\nAdd a README\nJust run the following in the Console:\nuse_readme_rmd()\nThen open README.Rmd and edit this. This is a good place to put a description of the package, who it is intended for, and some likely use cases.\nThis is a helpful place to let users, especially new users, know how to load your package, and how to access the datasets. Show an example or two.\nIt is also a good place to add a table with the names of the datasets and links to the descriptions and codebooks.\nCheck and install\ncheck()\ninstall()\nBuild\nThe Build tab in RStudio will let you Build Package which will also restart R.\nThis will give you a clean slate and re-load (library) your datapackage.\nOnce you are happy with the datapackage, commit and push to Github. Now anyone can use you datapackage.\n\n\n\n",

You can fork this from https://github.com/higgi13425/mini_flipbooks if you would like.\nNew File\nOpen a new file - File/New/Rmarkdown/From Template/Ninja Themed Presentation\n(Note: it is often easiest to open a working example, like across_microflip_1 - this will include YAML edits, setup packages, etc., and Save As.. to the name of your new micro-flipbook)\nName it\nThen give it a name, like  function-name_microflip_#_topic.Rmd (increment # for each additional example)\nDelete Lots of Stuff\nThen delete everything from line 30 - line 576 if you are using the Ninja template.\nEdit the YAML\nUpdate\ntitle\nedit or remove subtitle\nauthor\nadd one line to nature:\nratio: 16:9\n\nEdit the Setup chunk\nEdit opts_chunk$set to include\n\n\n\nand delete options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)\nThen Add\nlibrary(flipbookr)\nlibrary(xaringan)\nlibrary(xaringanthemer)\nlibrary(medicaldata) or other data source\nother libraries that are needed for functions\nload any data files needed into a named dataframe, like  prostate <- medicaldata::blood_storage %>% as_tibble()\nEdit the xaringan-themer chunk\nFor a consistent style, I use:\n\n\nxaringanthemer::style_duo_accent(\n  primary_color = \"#00274C\",\n  secondary_color = \"#FFCB05\",\n  header_font_google = google_font(\"Lato\"),\n  text_font_google   = google_font(\"Manrope\"),\n  code_font_google   = google_font(\"Roboto Mono\"),\n  base_font_size = \"20px\",\n   code_font_size = \"2rem\",\n)   \n\n\n\n You can copy and paste this style, or  you can make your own version.\nStart adding headers to preparatory slide\n3 hashtags - title line on slide  4 hashtags - subhead text  Also add body text to explain what you are going to be showing.\nShow the syntax and arguments\nthen add a divider to start a new slide with 3 horizontal dashes on a single line.  This next slide will be your flipbook slide\nAdd your named chunk of R code\ngive it a name, like ttest1\nuse the option include = FALSE\nadd lots of explanatory comments\nExample:\n\n\n# start with data\nprostate %>%\n# apply t_test from infer\n# with correct arguments\n  t_test(TVol ~ AA, \n         order = c(\"0\", \"1\"))\n# Interpreting the output:\n# The t statistic is first\n# followed by degrees of freedom\n# then the p value\n# the default alternative: two.sided\n# then the confidence bounds\n# output is a tibble so that it is \n# easy to use these results\n\n\n\n Note that explanatory material is put in comments with a hashtag - can be in-between code lines, or at the end\nThen reveal your code line by line with inline r code using the chunk_reveal function:\n\nchunk_reveal(\"ttest1\", \n    break_type = \"auto\", \n    title = \"Tidy version from the {infer} package\")`\n\n Note that this references the name of the chunk above,  sets the break_type to “auto” (there are lots of other options), and  gives the microflipbook slide itself a title.\nThen (if you want more explanatory material) insert a new slide by adding 3 dashes alone on a single line\nAdd the explanatory text with Rmd formatting.\nThen (if desired) add a css chunk (example below) to adjust your code font - can adjust line height or font size.\nThis css chunk does not have to be on a separate slide\n\n.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}\n\nTo clarify that your student has reached the end of the flipbook, you can add a comment line, like ### THE END\nor even a divider line\nWith 3 dashes ---\nto create a new slide with #THE END\n\n\n\n",

This is a higher bar, and one we should strive for, but we are a long way from this. \nAs a first step toward reproducibility, we should collect data in a secure, ethical, and HIPAA-compliant way. \nWe should store data in standard (tidy) formats, and validate their quality during (not after) data entry. \nWe should have an audit trail of every change to the data, and a documented reason, date, and identity of the person making the data edit. \nWe should keep data out of spreadsheets, which do not promote reproducible data analysis, and frequently get in the way. \nWe should preserve (and comment) our data analysis in code, so that it can be re-run and reproduced in the future. \nWe should document our raw data, our code (all steps), and our computing environment, including all computer systems and software and packages used, so that others can reproduce our work. \nIdeally, we should preserve a snapshot of our computing environment, with tools like Docker and binderhub to allow easy reproduction of our data analysis even years in the future. \nIf our data, and each step in the analysis, can not be reproduced, it should not be trusted. \n\n\n",
