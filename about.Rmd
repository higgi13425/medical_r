### About me
My name is Peter Higgins, and I work at the University of Michigan, where I am a Professor of Internal Medicine and take care of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. I do a variety of research projects related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which range from basic science to translational drug development to clinical trials to epidemiology.<br>

### About This Blog
I am blogging about the use of R with medical data, and will tackle topics like 

- best practices for data collection and entry
- data security and PHI
- how to build `learnr` modules for teaching
- how to build `flipbooks` for teaching
- how to build an e-book with bookdown

If you would like to build a `distill`-based blog like this, follow the rstudio guide at:

and the walk-through from Thomas Mock at:

This website is published with Github Pages (using Rmarkdown and the `distill` framework, rather than Github's `jekyll` default), and details on how to set up your Github repo as a webpage can be found at:
