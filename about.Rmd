My name is Peter Higgins, and I work at the University of Michigan, where I am a Professor of Internal Medicine and take care of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. I do a variety of research projects related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which range from basic science to translational drug development to clinical trials to epidemiology.
