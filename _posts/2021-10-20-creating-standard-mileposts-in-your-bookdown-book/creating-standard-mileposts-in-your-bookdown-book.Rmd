## Div.tips in RMRWR

It is common to want to create standard mileposts for recurring kinds of items in a bookdown book, like:

- tips
- warnings
- gotchas
- challenges
- try it yourself

etc.

You can set these up, as outlined by Desiree De Leon, with div tips, as seen [here](https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2019/making-tip-boxes-with-bookdown-and-rmarkdown/). These are pandoc style custom divs, set up with css. These will work for .Rmd, bookdown, distill, and blogdown, but no tfor xaringan, .md, or .Rmarkdown. 


## Key Steps
1. set up your CSS file, and customize
2. link up your CSS file to your bookdown book in the YAML header
3. supply small, informative icon files for each kind of div tip you want.

## Setting up CSS
1. If you don’t already have one, create a CSS file by going to File > New File > Text File.
2. Name this file style.css (you can choose a different name) and save it in your project directory. Mine is in the `include` subdirectory.

## Editing your YAML

Open the file `_site.yml` and add to the output the following:

- for straight HTML, 

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
output: 
  html_document: 
    css: include/style.css 
```

- for distill blogposts, 

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
output: 
  distill::distill_article:
    css: include/style.css
```

- and for bookdown books, 

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    css: include/style.css 
```

For a bookdown in the Gitbook style

If you’re working in bookdown, do this by making sure your _output.yml has this:

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
output: 
  bookdown::gitbook:
    css: include/style.css
```

## Now Editing `style.css` to Style our div tips
You can set:

- background-color:
- color: (of text)
- border: (thickness, color)

Here is an example of css to paste into style.css

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
/* -----------div tips------------- */

  div.puzzle, div.fyi, div.demo, div.note {
    padding: 1em;
    margin: 1em 0;
    padding-left: 100px;
    background-size: 70px;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 15px center;
    min-height: 120px;
    color: #1f5386;
    background-color: #bed3ec;
    border: solid 5px #dfedff;
  }
```

Use short names after `div.`

You can have different styles for each div.x

Consider giving div.tips a different google font, and specify the `font-family` in the style.css file.

## Add Images

Pick a distinct, informative image for each div.tip

Use .PNG images with transparent backgrounds

Save the images in your `images` directory. Mine are saved in
`include/images_included`. This is so that they are easily found relative to `style.css`, which is also in the `include` folder in my RMRWR bookdown project.

Open  `style.css`

Paste in your style rules to add images, as below

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
div.puzzle {
  background-image: url("images_included/warning.png");
}

div.fyi {
 background-image: url("images_included/fyi.png");
}

div.demo {
  background-image: url("images_included/Live-code.png");
}

div.note {
  background-image: url("images_included/lightbulb.png");
}
```

Change the file path within the `url()` field for each div.tip style so that it points to the correct image that you want to use. These urls are **relative** to where your CSS file (_style.css_) lives.

## Now to USE your div.tips

Start off with 3 colons `:::` followed by the `.{name}`of the div.tip, then <br> on a new line add content, then <br> a new line then add 3 colons to close
`:::`

as in:

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
:::{.warning}

content goes here

:::
  
```

## Div.tips in RMRWR

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
example of div.warning

:::{.warning}
warning content 
:::
```

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
example of div.tip

:::{.tip}
tip content 
:::
```

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
example of div.tryit

:::{.tryit}
try an example content 
:::
```

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
example of div.challenge

:::{.challenge}
challenge (end of chapter) content 
:::
```

``` {r  eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
